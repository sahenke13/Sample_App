# SAMPLE RUBY APP

This is a application being completed by Steven Henke as part of the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
```bundle install --without production```

Next you will need to migrate the database:
```rails db:migrate```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
```rails test```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server: ```rails server```
